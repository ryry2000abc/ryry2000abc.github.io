The first modern Olympics, held in Greece, demonstrate the increasing willingness the US had to get involved in foreign affairs.
Just as the US was becoming more involved in imperialism, so it was becoming more involved in foreign affairrs (such as the olympics) overall.
Despite only 14 countries attending, France and Germany had to be convinced to join, due to an long-lasting feud between the two countries because of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.
Women couldn't participate in these Olympics, leading to a protest led by Greek athlete Stamata Revithi. She ran the marathon course a day after it had happened, to prove that women can compete. Many attribute this protest to the reason women were able to participate in the 1900 Olympics.
