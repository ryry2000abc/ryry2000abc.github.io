Women first competed in the olympics in 1900.
Some of the participants, (including medal winners), were unaware that they competed in the Olympics. This was because these olympics
were part of France's "world faire", or "Exposition Universelle". This World Faire, according to the french, celebrated the dawn 
of a new era. Besides the olympics, it featured machines, inventions, and architecture. As the French were experiencing a new era, so were
the Americans. In the dawn of the progressive era, one of the exhibitions was actually the <a href="/wiki/The_Exhibit_of_American_Negroes" title="The Exhibit of American Negroes">The Exhibit of American Negroes</a>, 
which Frances Benjamin Johnston, a friend of Booker T. Washington, displayed photos of his black students. Ultimately this exhibit was aimed at
showing the positive contributions which African Americans were making in American society. This was perhaps, a precursor to the 
sentiments of the Harlem Renaissance.
