 </br>First Olympic games held in a Socalist country:
 </br>Because of the outbreak of the Cold War, President Jimmy Carter advocated a boycott of the Olympics.
 </br>Due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, where a total of 66 countries boycotted the Moscow Olympics,
 </br>1980 had the lowest participation rate of an Olympics at 80 nations present.
 </br>The United States boycott led the Soviet Union to boycott the 1984 Olympics located in the US.
 </br>Elite athletes from the USSR and US wouldn't compete again until the 1988 Olympics.
