Last olympics for USSR and East Germany.
N. Korea and Cuba boycotted
Solidified S. Korea's westernization, showcased the Korean economic miricle, and legitamized the government's control
N. Korea wanted to co-host the olympics, and boycotted when this did not happen
No continued boycott by Eastern Bloc
Another funny moment: <br/>
 Doves in the olympic cauldron, which is burned for the entirity of the games each year, were intended to fly away when the cauldron was lit during the opening ceremonies. Instead, many of the doves refused to fly away, and instead burned alive.
