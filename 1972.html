The Infamous Munich massacre: Israeli athletes were held hostaged by Palestinian terrorists, who were part of a group called Black September. They
invaded the Olympic Village, as a botched rescue attempt by Germany resulted in the deaths of all Israli hostages,
this event helped form Germany's elite-counterterrism unit, GSG 9. Nixon discussed many ways to deal with the aforementioned Munich massacre, and in the end, this was one of the events that led him to 
start focusing more on a fight against terrorism. Additionally, America, in aiding an effort to find the terrorists behind the attack,
began their image as being Israel's main benefactors. The basketball game between the US and Soviet Union is regarded as the most controversial, 
because the US appeared to have won 50-49, but the final 3 seconds were played three times until the Soviets
came out 50-51; the United States refused their silver medals. This represented the controversial Cold War tensions.
