Symbolic battle between the US and Germany, representing democracy and fascism.
Jesse Owens breaks olympic records, a blow to Hitler's claims of the superiority of the Aryan race.
Germany won the olympics, and the US came in second.
The '36 Olympics were the first to have live television coverage, which reflected the
growth of technology during each olympics. 
Many nation's representatives, while walking past f√ºhrer Adolf Hitler purposefully gave the nazi salute. The event represented the growing 
control of Hitler's reign (this was to him and his nation, an event all about him), and the scale of the growing tensions of wwII.
 
This Olympics greatly represented Hitler's own ideals, though when he to prevent women, blacks, and from being able to compete, most other nations threatened to boycott.
This not only showed the progressive idea of women's importance in society, but it also reflected the small beginnings to countries rejecting racist views.
